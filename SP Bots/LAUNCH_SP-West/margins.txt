Margin percentages tabulated by price (odds) and index.
  Price assumes 350 discrete values in the range [1.01,1000].
  Index is determined by settings in config.txt or config_per_race.txt.
Margin values may be either integral or decimal, for example 3 or 3.4.
If margins are intended to be identical for all prices then only a single
line of values need be specified and it will be replicated as necessary.
The first line of the file that begins with a numeric value is assumed
to represent the start of margin data.
